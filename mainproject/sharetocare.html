      a family to family platform that makes sure donations can be delivered
      directly into the hands of those families in need.

    <p>
      SharetoCare aims at linking abundant families that have more to give, to
      families in need of kids clothing, toys and books
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>Our goals are</p>
      <li>Minimize plastic waste caused by the toy industry</li>
      <p>
        Did you know that 90% of kids toys are made of plastics, but 80% of all
        toys end up in trash heap, and it takes up to 1000 years to decompose
        plastics in landfill. For every 1 million the toy industry makes, 40
        tons of plastics are used.
      </p>
      <li>Reusing second-hand clothes, toys and books</li>
      <p>
        We want to help parents who don't know what to do with all the outgrown
        clothes and toys;We want to help families who works hard to put food on
        the table for their kids, but can afford only that
      </p>
      <li>Feed those hungry minds that are so eager to learn</li>
      <li>Preserve a better environment for our future generations</li>
    </ul>
